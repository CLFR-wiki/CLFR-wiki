## What Can You Contribute?

Our public repository, **CLFR-wiki**, is dedicated solely to the editable wiki content—such as team pages, articles, and other community-maintained information. This repository **does not** contain the full source code of the project. The proprietary “meat” of the code (layouts, core components, build processes, etc.) is maintained separately and is not open for public contribution.

### Editable Content

- **Wiki Pages:**  
  All content pages (written as `.astro` files) that house team files, guides, articles, and other informational content are open for contribution.

- **Content Templates:**  
  You are welcome to use our provided templates to add or update pages. These templates serve as a starting point and ensure consistency across the wiki.

### What’s Not Open

- **Proprietary Code:**  
  The core application logic, layouts, and components that power the site’s design and functionality remain proprietary. We ask that you do not modify or request changes to these sections.

### Example File Structure

In our public repository, you might see files like:

```
src/pages/teams/
  ├── team1.astro
  ├── team2.astro
  └── ...
src/pages/guides/
  ├── contribute.astro
  └── ...
```

These files represent the content that you’re free to edit or add to. The proprietary parts (e.g., `src/layouts/Layout.astro` and other core components) are kept separate and are not part of the public contribution process.
