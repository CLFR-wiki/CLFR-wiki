description: "A pink liquid virus that infects through ingestion or open wounds. It rapidly converts other liquids into itself. Once infected, it causes veins to burst, leading to bruising and pinkish/purple skin. Blood cells turn pink, the heart rate increases, and blood pools. Pinkish cysts filled with blood form across the body, acting as a secondary circulation system. Popping these cysts weakens the individual and can lead to death.",
