BIMF-20 is a pink liquid that infects the individual through ingestion or open wounds. Introducing this liquid to any other liquid will result in it rapidly turning that liquid into the same compound that BIMF-20 consists of. Once infected the virus will being to burst the veins across the entire body. Resulting in bruising, and pinkish/purple colored skin pigmentation. The blood cells will also begin to turn to a pinkish color hue. The heart of the individual rapidly increases in speed, resulting in rapid blood flow and blood pooling all across the inside of the body. With the blood cells and veins popping, the body mutates and forms pinkish cysts across the body where a large amount of the blood is stored inside of. The individual does not seem to bleed out from the lack of blood until the cysts are popped, with theroies suggesting these cysts are serving as a new form of venous circulation for the body. Popping these cysts will result in the infected individual weakening and likely resulting in death if too many are popped.
