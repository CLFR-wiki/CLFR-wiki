# Migration Notice

As an overall decision by the maintainers of CLFR.wiki, we have decided to move our focus to using MediaWiki as opposed to Astro. This means that this repository may be slowly migrated to the new wiki, or may not. 

Please note that any actions made on this wiki may be gradual or even sporadic.

# Wiki Roadmap

Welcome to the CLFR.wiki Roadmap! This section outlines the current status of our content and highlights the areas that need improvement. Your contributions can make a huge difference! 

> **P.S.** Everything on this wiki is written in Astro. If you’re not yet familiar with Astro but still want to help, you can contribute by reviewing changes, suggesting improvements, or even by copying one of our ready-made templates to create new pages.

## Overview

- **Content:** 2 out of ? pages completed

## Teams

Our Teams section is still in its early stages. Here are some key areas where your help is needed:

- **Team Profiles:**  
  Each team has a placeholder page, but we need detailed profiles that include history, roles, responsibilities, and pricing information.

- **Sub-Team Breakdowns:**  
  Many teams require additional pages for sub-teams with in-depth descriptions and data.  
  *Example: Create full pages for sub-teams like "Special Tactics Unit" or "Veteran Handler" with relevant details.*

- **Consistent Data:**  
  Ensure that all pages follow a consistent format, especially for pricing tables and team descriptions.

## Content

Apart from team pages, we need to expand the overall content of the wiki:

- **Guides & Articles:**  
  - **Getting Started:** A beginner’s guide to help new players navigate the game.
  - **Advanced Strategies:** In-depth articles covering game mechanics, team interactions, and more.
  - **Content Templates:** Our templates need refinement. Help us standardize the format across the wiki.

- **Under Construction Pages:**  
  Many pages are currently marked as under construction.  
  *Your contribution can transform these into fully informative articles.*
